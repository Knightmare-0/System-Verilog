		Caching library 'worklib' ....... Done
	Elaborating the design hierarchy:
	Top level design units:
		$unit_0x035f4a23
		top
xmelab: *W,DSEMEL: This SystemVerilog design will be simulated as per IEEE 1800-2009 SystemVerilog simulation semantics. Use -disable_sem2009 option for turning off SV 2009 simulation semantics.

	Extracting FSMs for coverage:
		worklib.tb_fsm
		worklib.fsm
			FSM extracted for state register cst
		worklib.top
	Total FSMs extracted = 1
	Building instance overlay tables: ....................
xmelab: *W,COVFHT: FSM hold transitions (transitions to the current state) are not extracted for any FSM in default mode.
 Done
	Enabling instrumentation for coverage types: block expression FSM toggle functional
xmelab: *W,COVDCL: By default expression coverage is scored only for Verilog logical operators (|| and &&) and VHDL logical operators (OR, AND, NOR, and NAND), and is scored only in condition expressions. To score coverage for other operators and for expressions in other statements, use the "set_expr_coverable_operators" and "set_expr_coverable_statements" coverage configuration file commands with suitable options at elaboration.
